coderpath summer 2018 prework

Contains the following problems:

- Checkpoint 1: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/amortized2/
- Checkpoint 2: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/prettyprint/
- Checkpoint 3: https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/checkpoint/3/
- Checkpoint 4: https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/checkpoint/4/
- Checkpoint 5: https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/checkpoint/5/

Problems that have not been completed:

- Checkpoint 4_1 (linked list)
- Checkpoint 5_2 (sequences)

TODO:

- read back up on linked lists in order to do the linked list question
- read back up on dynamic programming in order to do the sequence question

Notes:

- for 3B, check if there are pointers in CTCI about dealing with continuous subsequences 
  - intended solution is to use three pointers, it's not obvious to think that way
